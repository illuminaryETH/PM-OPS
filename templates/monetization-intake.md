# Monetization Modeling Intake

> Copy this file to `workflows/monetization/intake/` and fill it in.
> Name it descriptively: `tiered-pricing-revamp.md`, `usage-based-billing.md`, etc.

## Initiative Name

<!-- What are we modeling? -->

## Product / Feature Description

<!-- What is being priced or monetized? 3-5 sentences. -->

## Pricing Questions to Answer

1. <!-- e.g., "What price point maximizes revenue in the first 12 months?" -->
2. <!-- e.g., "How does a freemium tier affect conversion vs. a free trial?" -->
3.

## Current Pricing (if applicable)

- **Current model**:
- **Current price points**:
- **Current conversion rate** (free-to-paid, trial-to-paid, etc.):
- **Current churn rate**:
- **Current ARPU / ARPA**:

## Pricing Assumptions for Modeling

- **Proposed model**: <!-- e.g., "Per-seat monthly SaaS", "Usage-based per API call", "Tiered flat rate" -->
- **Proposed price points / tiers**:
- **Expected conversion rate**: <!-- Your best guess, with basis -->
- **Expected churn rate**: <!-- Monthly or annual -->

## Cost Inputs

- **Variable cost per user/unit**: <!-- e.g., hosting, support, COGS per customer -->
- **Fixed costs**: <!-- e.g., "Engineering team costs $X/mo regardless of customers" -->
- **Customer acquisition cost (CAC)** (approx):

## Growth Assumptions

- **Current user / customer count**:
- **Expected growth rate**: <!-- Monthly or annual, with basis -->
- **Growth channels**:
- **Seasonality**: <!-- Any cyclical patterns? -->

## Comparable Products / Benchmarks

| Product | Model | Price | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|
|         |       |       |       |
|         |       |       |       |

## Scenarios to Model

1. <!-- e.g., "Conservative: 5% MoM growth, 3% churn" -->
2. <!-- e.g., "Base case: 10% MoM growth, 2% churn" -->
3. <!-- e.g., "Optimistic: 15% MoM growth, 1.5% churn" -->

## Time Horizon

<!-- How far out should the model project? e.g., "12 months", "3 years" -->
