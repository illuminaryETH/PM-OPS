# Constraints and Resources

## Team

- **Product team size**: <!-- e.g., "1 PM, 4 engineers, 1 designer" -->
- **Relevant skill gaps**:
- **Bandwidth**: <!-- Are people fully allocated? What % is available for new work? -->

## Budget

- **Available budget for new initiatives**:
- **Spending constraints**: <!-- e.g., "No new headcount until Series B", "Cloud costs capped at $X/mo" -->

## Technical Constraints

- **Infrastructure limitations**: <!-- e.g., "Monolith — no microservices yet", "Single-region deployment" -->
- **Data limitations**: <!-- e.g., "No data warehouse, analytics via product DB queries" -->
- **Integration requirements**: <!-- Must integrate with X, Y, Z -->
- **Compliance / regulatory**: <!-- e.g., SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR -->

## Timeline Pressures

- **Hard deadlines**: <!-- e.g., "Must ship before Q3 board meeting" -->
- **Soft deadlines**: <!-- e.g., "Would like to have this for the conference in June" -->

## Dependencies

- **External**: <!-- e.g., "Waiting on API access from partner" -->
- **Internal**: <!-- e.g., "Needs data eng team to build pipeline first" -->

## Risk Tolerance

- **How much experimentation is acceptable?** <!-- e.g., "Can run betas with 10% of users" -->
- **Appetite for pricing experiments?** <!-- e.g., "Can A/B test pricing on new signups only" -->
